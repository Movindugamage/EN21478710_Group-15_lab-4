ABSTRACT


The PIC16f877A microcontroller was mainly used to develop a system for controlling the water level in a water tank. The MPLabs software was used to develop a C language program. Proteus software was used to create a schematic layout of the necessary circuit, which was later converted to a PCB layout to create the circuit that was required. Additionally, DC motors, IR sensors, Motor relays etc. were used to create the required circuit.


Objectives

<br>•	To develop a small water level controlling system of a water tank using the knowledge of interrupts and other programming techniques of PIC16f877a.
